        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
          In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can be mild,
          such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses),
          and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary:
          in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea.
          There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

        Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae,
        order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense
        single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses
        ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases, the largest among known RNA viruses. The name
        coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo", which refers to the
        characteristic appearance reminiscent of a solar corona around the virions (virus particles) when
        viewed under two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy, due to the surface being covered in
        club-shaped protein spikes.

      <h1>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</h1>
      <p>
        According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough.
        Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or
        diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who
        get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without
        needing any special treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying
        medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory
        conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as
        experiencing either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A high temperature – you feel hot to touch on your chest or back.</li>
        <li>A new continuous cough – this means you have started coughing repeatedly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not
        work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.
